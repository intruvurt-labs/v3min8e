# Placeholder Contract Addresses Audit

## Overview

This document identifies all placeholder contract addresses in the codebase that must be updated before production deployment. These placeholders ensure the app functions in development while preventing accidental interaction with undeployed contracts.

## Critical Security Note ⚠️

**ALL PLACEHOLDER ADDRESSES MUST BE REPLACED WITH REAL CONTRACT ADDRESSES BEFORE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

Deploying with placeholder addresses will result in:

- Non-functional token swaps and staking
- User transaction failures
- Potential fund loss if users interact with invalid addresses

## Identified Placeholder Contracts

### 1. JupiterSwap.tsx

**File:** `client/components/JupiterSwap.tsx`  
**Lines:** 27-31

```typescript
const CONTRACTS = {
  VERM_TOKEN: "PLACEHOLDER_VERM_TOKEN_CONTRACT", // Update after deployment
  GRIT_TOKEN: "PLACEHOLDER_GRIT_TOKEN_CONTRACT", // Update after deployment
  STAKING_PROGRAM: "PLACEHOLDER_STAKING_PROGRAM_ID", // Update after deployment
};
```

**Impact:** Jupiter swap functionality will fail
**Required Action:** Replace with actual Solana SPL token addresses and staking program ID

### 2. StakingEnhanced.tsx

**File:** `client/pages/StakingEnhanced.tsx`  
**Lines:** 34-40

```typescript
const STAKING_CONTRACTS = {
  VERM_TOKEN: "PLACEHOLDER_VERM_TOKEN_CONTRACT", // Will be updated after deployment
  GRIT_TOKEN: "PLACEHOLDER_GRIT_TOKEN_CONTRACT", // Will be updated after deployment
  VERM_STAKING_PROGRAM: "PLACEHOLDER_VERM_STAKING_PROGRAM", // Will be updated after deployment
  GRIT_STAKING_PROGRAM: "PLACEHOLDER_GRIT_STAKING_PROGRAM", // Will be updated after deployment
  TREASURY_WALLET: "PLACEHOLDER_TREASURY_WALLET", // Will be updated after deployment
};
```

**Impact:** Staking functionality will fail, user funds cannot be staked or unstaked
**Required Action:** Replace with actual deployed contract addresses

### 3. Technology.tsx

**File:** `client/pages/Technology.tsx`  
**Lines:** 598, 628-635

**Program ID Placeholder:**

```typescript
PROGRAM ID (PLACEHOLDER)
⚠️ Placeholder ID - will be updated after mainnet deployment
```

**Impact:** Documentation displays incorrect program information
**Required Action:** Update with actual deployed program ID

## Validation Functions

### Contract Deployment Check

The following function in StakingEnhanced.tsx checks if contracts are deployed:

```typescript
const checkContractsDeployed = () => {
  const verm = !STAKING_CONTRACTS.VERM_TOKEN.includes("PLACEHOLDER");
  const grit = !STAKING_CONTRACTS.GRIT_TOKEN.includes("PLACEHOLDER");
  const stakingPrograms =
    !STAKING_CONTRACTS.VERM_STAKING_PROGRAM.includes("PLACEHOLDER");
  return verm && grit && stakingPrograms;
};
```

This prevents users from interacting with undeployed contracts in production.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Deployment:

1. **Deploy Solana Contracts:**

   - [ ] Deploy VERM token contract
   - [ ] Deploy GRIT token contract
   - [ ] Deploy VERM staking program
   - [ ] Deploy GRIT staking program
   - [ ] Set up treasury wallet

2. **Update Contract Addresses:**

   - [ ] Replace VERM_TOKEN placeholder in JupiterSwap.tsx
   - [ ] Replace GRIT_TOKEN placeholder in JupiterSwap.tsx
   - [ ] Replace STAKING_PROGRAM placeholder in JupiterSwap.tsx
   - [ ] Replace all placeholders in StakingEnhanced.tsx
   - [ ] Update Technology.tsx documentation

3. **Verify Contract Integration:**

   - [ ] Test Jupiter swap functionality with real contracts
   - [ ] Test staking functionality with real contracts
   - [ ] Verify all contract interactions work correctly
   - [ ] Test error handling with invalid addresses

4. **Security Validation:**
   - [ ] Audit contract addresses for correctness
   - [ ] Verify contract ownership and permissions
   - [ ] Test with small amounts before full deployment
   - [ ] Confirm treasury wallet security

## Error Handling

The app includes proper error handling for placeholder contracts:

### JupiterSwap.tsx Error Handling:

```typescript
// Check for placeholder contracts
if (inputMint.includes("PLACEHOLDER") || outputMint.includes("PLACEHOLDER")) {
  throw new Error(
    "Token contract not yet deployed. Please wait for deployment.",
  );
}

if (error.message?.includes("PLACEHOLDER")) {
  setError("Token contracts are being deployed. Please check back soon.");
}
```

### User-Facing Messages:

- "Token contracts are still being deployed. Please check back soon."
- "Contract Pending Deployment" (displayed in UI)
- "Token contract not yet deployed. Please wait for deployment."

## Environment Variables

Consider using environment variables for contract addresses:

```typescript
const CONTRACTS = {
  VERM_TOKEN:
    import.meta.env.VITE_VERM_TOKEN_ADDRESS ||
    "PLACEHOLDER_VERM_TOKEN_CONTRACT",
  GRIT_TOKEN:
    import.meta.env.VITE_GRIT_TOKEN_ADDRESS ||
    "PLACEHOLDER_GRIT_TOKEN_CONTRACT",
  STAKING_PROGRAM:
    import.meta.env.VITE_STAKING_PROGRAM_ID || "PLACEHOLDER_STAKING_PROGRAM_ID",
};
```

This allows different addresses for development, staging, and production environments.

## Deployment Process

### Recommended Deployment Order:

1. Deploy and verify all smart contracts on Solana mainnet
2. Update all placeholder addresses in the codebase
3. Test all functionality in staging environment
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor contract interactions for any issues

### Post-Deployment Verification:

- Verify all contract addresses are accessible
- Test token swaps with small amounts
- Test staking/unstaking functionality
- Monitor for any transaction failures
- Check that all error handling works correctly

## Security Considerations

- **Never deploy with placeholder addresses** - this will break functionality
- **Verify contract ownership** - ensure contracts are owned by correct addresses
- **Test thoroughly** - verify all interactions work before public launch
- **Monitor transactions** - watch for any failed transactions after deployment
- **Have rollback plan** - be prepared to quickly fix any issues
